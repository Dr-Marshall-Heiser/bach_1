# bach_1

This is a simple Max patch. You will need to install the (free) Bach externals library (by Andrea Agostini and Daniele Ghisi) via the Max Package Manager if you haven't already. The picture file seen in the related youtube video is not included, but the pictcrtl object is, so you can add your own picture as desired.
